<h2>Backend Technologies:</h2>
Spring Boot.
Java WebSocket: A Java API for creating WebSocket applications, enabling real-time communication for the chat feature.
Java Mail Sender: Used for sending email notifications and implementing account verification.


<h2>Frontend Technologies:</h2>
React.js.
Bootstrap.
STOMP.js: A JavaScript library that provides a simple and flexible API for working with the WebSocket protocol.
SockJS Client: A WebSocket emulation library used as a fallback for browsers that do not support WebSocket natively.


<h2>Description:</h2> 
This project is a web application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. It serves as a comprehensive clinic management system that allows efficient administration of a dental clinic. The system features multiple user roles, including an administrator, clients, and dentists.

<h3>Features</h3>
User Administration:
The administrator has the authority to create, update, and delete client and dentist user accounts.

<h4>Dental Appointments:</h4>
Users can create and delete dental appointments, making it easier to manage patient schedules.

<h4>Video Uploads:</h4>
The system provides a user-friendly interface for clients to upload promotional videos, which are then displayed on the client's landing page.

<h4>Client Landing Page:</h4>
Clients have a personalized landing page where they can access promotional videos, clinic information, such as location on Google Maps, and make appointments.

Chat Functionality:
Clients can choose a dentist and engage in real-time chat within the application.
Dentists can review their chat history with patients and manage appointments.

<h4>Profile Management:</h4>
Users can modify their profiles, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
Account Verification:

The system incorporates email verification to enhance security and ensure the validity of user accounts.

<h2>What I've Learned</h2>

<h3>Improved Productivity:</h3>

Working with Java and Spring Boot enabled me to develop robust and scalable backend functionality efficiently.
Leveraging React and Bootstrap in the frontend allowed me to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces quickly.
Code Quality:

Through extensive use of Java and Spring Boot, I gained a deeper understanding of best practices for writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
Identifying common error patterns specific to Java and React helped me proactively address potential issues, resulting in more reliable and error-free code.
Email Communication:

Implementing Java Mail Sender in the project allowed me to integrate email notification functionalities, such as account verification and appointment reminders, enhancing user experience and system communication.
Real-time Chat:

Incorporating WebSocket communication using Java WebSocket, STOMP.js, and SockJS Client enabled the development of a real-time chat feature within the application, improving user engagement and interactivity.
